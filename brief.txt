## **1. APP OVERVIEW & CORE OBJECTIVES**

- **Goal**: Build a **Streamlit** dashboard that projects up to **10 years** of financials (with an option for monthly or quarterly detail). 
- **Users**:  
  1. **Admin / Finance** – Full edit rights to all assumptions (staff salaries, overhead, marketing budgets, growth rates, churn, etc.).  
  2. **Executives / Investors** – Read-only or limited interaction (view scenarios, see charts, generate PDF/Excel exports).

### **Must-Have Features**  
1. Real-time **financial projections** (Revenue, COS, Operating Expenses, EBITDA, Net Income, Ending Cash).  
2. **SaaS metrics**: MRR, ARR, churn, LTV, CAC, payback period, staff-to-client ratio.  
3. **Staffing logic**: auto-calculate new hires based on onboarding/support hours.  
4. **Funding rounds**: equity vs. loan, flexible amounts and timelines.  
5. **Presets & scenario analysis**: Base, Optimistic, Rapid AI.  
6. **Visualizations**: revenue vs. OPEX chart, staff growth vs. client growth, ending cash, etc.  

---

## **2. DETAILED INPUTS & ADMIN PANEL REQUIREMENTS**

All the following **input fields** must be **editable** in an **Admin Panel** (or multiple tabs in the Streamlit app). The admin must be able to change any numeric values, turn scenarios on/off, or add new items (e.g., new staff roles, new overhead items, additional growth or churn options, new funding rounds).

Below is a **complete** list of recommended input boxes/controls:

### **2.1. Global Financial & Company Setup**

| **Field**                 | **Default Example** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Company Name*            | `askAYYI`          | Used throughout the dashboard and exports.                                                                                                                      |
| *Corporate Tax Rate* (%)  | `28`               | Applied to EBITDA to get tax expense.                                                                                                                           |
| *Inflation Rate* (%)      | `5`                | Applied annually to overhead, salaries, etc.                                                                                                                    |
| *Projection Horizon*      | `10 years`         | Number of years to forecast.                                                                                                                                    |
| *Periodicity*             | Annual / Quarterly / Monthly | Toggle to choose if calculations are done yearly (10 periods), quarterly (40 periods), or monthly (120 periods).                                               |
| *Initial Cash on Hand*    | `R 500,000`        | Starting cash balance (before any funding).                                                                                                                     |

### **2.2. Funding & Investment Rounds**

*(See Section [7](#7-funding--investment-rounds) for more details.)*  
For each funding round, the following fields:

1. **Round Name** (e.g., “Seed Round”, “PSG Investment”)  
2. **Round Timing** (e.g., “Year 2”, “Quarter 6”, “Month 18”)  
3. **Investment Amount** (e.g., R10,000,000)  
4. **Pre-Money Valuation** (if equity)  
5. **Equity %** (or negotiated stake)  
6. **Loan Terms** (if not equity): interest %, repayment schedule.  

The user must be able to add **multiple** rounds.

### **2.3. Plans & COS**

1. **Plan Names** (e.g., Basic, Advanced, Enterprise, White Label, etc.)  
2. **Monthly COS** (e.g., R4,268 for Basic, R9,445 for Advanced, etc.)  
3. **Setup COS** (e.g., R6,000 for Basic, R15,600 for Advanced, etc.)  
4. **Selling Price (Monthly)** (e.g., R9,869 for Basic, R21,709 for Advanced, etc.)  
5. **Setup Fee (Selling Price)** (e.g., R7,800 for Basic, R19,200 for Advanced, etc.)  
6. **Overages**: cost + markup for messages/minutes.  
   - Example: *Messages Cost* = R0.04, *Messages Selling Price* = R0.06, *Minutes Cost* = R2.22, *Minutes Selling Price* = ~R3.33.  

*(See Section [3](#3-plans--pricing-details) for a full table.)*

### **2.4. Staffing**

1. **Roles** (CEO, CTO, CFO, Admin, Onboarding, Tech Support, ML/AI Engineer, etc.).  
2. **Base Monthly Salary** for each role.  
3. **Initial Headcount**.  
4. **Annual Raise** percentage (e.g., 5%).  
5. **Capacity (hrs/month)** for each role if it’s impacted by client volume. Non-scaling roles might be set to a fixed headcount and no capacity logic.  

*(Details in Section [4](#4-staffing-details).)*

### **2.5. Overheads**

- **Office Rent & Utilities** (monthly cost, inflated by 5% yearly).  
- **Cloud Hosting / Tools** (monthly).  
- **Other Admin Overheads** (Insurance, legal, etc.).  

Each overhead item can be broken down or grouped. The admin panel should allow adding new overhead line items or editing existing ones.

### **2.6. Marketing & Sales**

- **Marketing Budget**: either a fixed monthly retainer or a percentage of revenue.  
  - Example: a monthly retainer of R120,000 for an external agency.  
- **Optional**: Additional marketing line items.  

### **2.7. Growth & Churn**

*(See Section [6](#6-growth-churn--client-distribution).)*  
- **Quarterly/Annual Growth Rate** for new client signups.  
- **Churn Rate**.  
- **Client Distribution** among Basic/Advanced/Enterprise (e.g., 40%/35%/25%).  
- **Initial Client Count** (total, plus breakdown per plan).

### **2.8. Onboarding & Support Hours**

- **Year 1 (or baseline) Onboarding Hours**: e.g., Basic = 12, Advanced = 24, Enterprise = 48.  
- **Reduction per year**: e.g., -50% each subsequent year or quarter.  
- **Monthly Support Hours** per plan: e.g., Basic = 2 hrs, Advanced = 5 hrs, Enterprise = 10 hrs.

### **2.9. Periodicity Adjustments**

If monthly or quarterly is chosen, all the above fields should either:  
- auto-distribute (e.g., 6% quarterly → ~2% monthly growth), or  
- let the user define monthly vs. quarterly growth directly.

---

## **3. PLANS & PRICING DETAILS**

Use the following **default** (all must be editable in the final dashboard):

| **Plan**       | **Monthly COS** | **Setup COS** | **Monthly Selling Price** | **Setup Selling Price** |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Basic**      | R4,268          | R6,000       | R9,869                   | R7,800                 |
| **Advanced**   | R9,445          | R15,600      | R21,709                  | R19,200                |
| **Enterprise** | R49,026         | R31,200      | R94,587                  | R45,600                |

#### **White Label Example**  
- *Basic White Label Setup COS*: R2,000  
- *Basic White Label Monthly Selling*: R12,600  

*(Add as many White Label plan types as needed.)*

#### **Overages**  
- **Messages**:  
  - *COS*: R0.04/msg  
  - *Selling*: R0.06/msg  
- **Minutes**:  
  - *COS*: R2.22/min  
  - *Selling*: ~R3.33/min  

> **Note**: Overages must be automatically calculated if usage surpasses the included allotment per plan (you can define or assume an included limit, e.g., 5,000 messages or 100 minutes, etc.).

---

## **4. STAFFING DETAILS**

There are two categories:

### **4.1. Non-Scaling (Fixed) Staff**

| **Role**               | **Default Headcount** | **Base Monthly Salary** | **Annual Raise** | **Notes**                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| CEO                    | 1                     | R80,000                | 5%               | Strategy, investor relations              |
| CTO                    | 1                     | R70,000                | 5%               | Tech roadmap, AI architecture            |
| CFO                    | 1                     | R65,000                | 5%               | Finance, compliance                       |
| Admin / Office Manager | 1                     | R18,000                | 5%               | Scheduling, office management, basic ops  |

> These do not auto-scale with new clients.

### **4.2. Scaling (Capacity-Driven) Staff**

| **Role**                     | **Default Headcount** | **Base Monthly Salary** | **Annual Raise** | **Capacity (hrs/mo)** | **Notes**                                |
|----------------------------- |-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Onboarding Specialist        | 2                     | R25,000                | 5%               | 160                   | Guides new client setup & training       |
| Technical Support Specialist | 1                     | R30,000                | 5%               | 160                   | Ticket handling, troubleshooting         |
| ML/AI Engineer               | 2                     | R50,000                | 5%               | 160 (approx.)        | Maintains AI models, data pipelines      |
| Full-Stack Dev               | 1                     | R40,000                | 5%               | 160                   | Front-end/back-end dev                   |
| QA Engineer                  | 1                     | R30,000                | 5%               | 160                   | Software testing, release QA             |

#### **Auto-Scaling Logic**  
- *Total Onboarding Hours needed per period* + *Total Support Hours* = **Total Hours**.  
- If **Total Hours** > (Available staff × 160 hrs each), **new staff** must be hired.  
  - The cost for **each** new staff member is that role’s monthly salary × (1 + raise factor each year if time passes).  
  - At a minimum, let the user choose if staff are “rounded up” with `ceil()`.

---

## **5. OVERHEADS & OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS**

**Default** monthly overhead items (annual 5% inflation):

| **Item**                   | **Monthly Cost** | **Annual Increase** | **Notes**                              |
|----------------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Office Rent & Utilities    | R40,000         | 5%                  | Tied to inflation each year            |
| Cloud Hosting / Tools      | R20,000         | 5%                  | AI compute, SaaS subscriptions         |
| Other Admin Overheads      | R10,000         | 5%                  | Insurance, legal, etc.                |
| External Sales/Marketing   | R120,000        | 5%                  | If using an external agency retainer   |

**Marketing Budget**  
- Either a **fixed** monthly budget or a **% of revenue**.  
- Default example: 0% or R0 if you want to keep it separate from the agency retainer.

*(All overhead items must be **editable** via the admin panel.)*

---

## **6. GROWTH, CHURN & CLIENT DISTRIBUTION**

### **6.1. Growth Rates**

- **Default** scenario: *Quarterly Growth* = 6%  
- **Optimistic**: 8–10% quarterly  
- **Rapid AI**: 12–15% quarterly  

*(If monthly detail is used, convert or let the user specify monthly growth directly.)*

### **6.2. Churn**

- **Default**: 10% annual (which can be ~0.83% monthly if monthly detail is used, or 2.5% quarterly if quarterly is used).  
- The user must be able to override or set a different churn per scenario.

### **6.3. Client Distribution (Plan Mix)**

- **Basic**: 40% of new signups  
- **Advanced**: 35%  
- **Enterprise**: 25%  

*(If White Label is relevant, add it as well, e.g., 5% to White Label, which reduces the other plan allocations proportionally.)*

### **6.4. Initial Clients**

- **Total**: 10 (4 Basic, 3 Advanced, 3 Enterprise).  
- The user can override these in the admin panel.

---

## **7. FUNDING & INVESTMENT ROUNDS**

### **7.1. Equity vs. Loan**  
- **Equity**: no repayment; the money goes into Ending Cash. Possibly changes ownership % (cap table).  
- **Loan**: track principal, interest rate, payback schedule (could be monthly, quarterly, yearly, or a lump sum after X years).

### **7.2. Example: PSG Round**  
- **Round Name**: “PSG Investment”  
- **Timing**: Year 1, Q4 (or any custom date)  
- **Amount**: R10,000,000  
- **Equity**: 8% stake, no payback (adds R10M to “Ending Cash”).  

*(The admin can add more rounds, like Series A, B, etc.)*

### **7.3. Additional Fields**  
- **Pre-Money Valuation**  
- **Post-Money Valuation**  
- **Ownership %** gained by new investor  
- **Loan Terms** (if it’s not equity)  

*(All these details feed into the cash flow statement and (optionally) a “Cap Table” section.)*

---

## **8. SAAS & FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS**

**All these formulas must be implemented.**  

### **8.1. Total Clients Calculation**

In each period (Month / Quarter / Year):  
1. **Starting Clients** = Previous Ending Clients.  
2. **New Clients** = (Starting Clients × Growth Rate).  
3. **Churned Clients** = (Starting Clients × Churn Rate).  
4. **Ending Clients** = Starting + New – Churned.  

*(Adjust for monthly/quarterly nuance; distribution of new clients across plans, etc.)*

### **8.2. Plan-Level Revenue**

- **Subscription Revenue** = (Avg. # of clients in each plan × Monthly Price) × # of months in period.  
  - If annual: simply (# of clients × annual price).  
- **Setup Fees** = (# of new signups in each plan × plan’s setup fee).  
- **Overage Revenue** = (overage usage × overage selling price) → If you track usage.

### **8.3. Cost of Sales (COS)**

- **Plan COS** = (# of clients in each plan × plan’s monthly COS) + (new signups × setup COS).  
- **Overage COS** = (overage usage × overage cost).

### **8.4. Operating Expenses**

1. **Staff Costs** = Sum of all salaries (scaling + fixed).  
   - For scaling staff, if you needed more staff, multiply the new total headcount by the monthly salary.  
   - Factor in annual raises.  
2. **Overheads** (office, cloud, admin, etc.) – inflated by 5% yearly.  
3. **Marketing** (fixed or % of revenue).

### **8.5. EBITDA & Net Income**

1. **Gross Profit** = Revenue – COS  
2. **EBITDA** = Gross Profit – Operating Expenses  
3. **Tax** = EBITDA × Corporate Tax Rate  
4. **Net Income** = EBITDA – Tax

### **8.6. Cash Flow & Ending Cash**

1. **Beginning Cash** (start of period)  
2. **+ Net Income**  
3. **+ Funding Inflows** (equity or loan)  
4. **– Loan Repayment / Interest** (if applicable)  
5. **= Ending Cash**  

*(Carry the Ending Cash to the next period’s Beginning Cash.)*

### **8.7. SaaS Metrics**

1. **MRR**: If monthly detail, sum up monthly recurring revenue.  
2. **ARR**: 12 × MRR (if monthly) or 4 × QRR (if quarterly).  
3. **CAC** = (Marketing + sales cost) / new clients.  
4. **LTV** = (Average monthly revenue per client – COS per client) ÷ monthly churn rate.  
5. **Payback Period** = CAC ÷ monthly net margin per new client.  
6. **Staff-to-Client Ratio** = # of staff in a certain role / # of total clients (or by plan if needed).

---

## **9. DATA TABLES, CHARTS & VISUALIZATIONS**

### **9.1. Required Data Tables**  
1. **Year-by-Year (or period-by-period) Table**:  
   - Starting Clients, New Clients, Churned, Ending Clients  
   - Plan mix (# in Basic, # in Advanced, etc.)  
   - Revenue by plan, COS by plan, Overages, etc.  
   - Staff count (by role), staff cost, overhead, marketing, total OPEX  
   - EBITDA, Tax, Net Income, Funding, Ending Cash  

*(The user should be able to expand to monthly or quarterly detail if chosen.)*

### **9.2. KPI Cards**  
- MRR / ARR  
- Net Income  
- EBITDA Margin (%)  
- Ending Cash  
- LTV  
- CAC  
- Payback Period  
- Staff-to-Client Ratio  

### **9.3. Charts**  
1. **Revenue vs. Operating Expenses** (over time)  
2. **Client Growth vs. Staff Growth**  
3. **Ending Cash** (cash flow line chart)  
4. **Scenario Comparison** (e.g., Base vs. Rapid AI side-by-side)  

### **9.4. Export Options**  
- **CSV / Excel**: export the raw table  
- **PDF**: summary with charts & tables  

---

## **10. SCENARIO ANALYSIS & PRESET PROFILES**

- **Scenario Presets** (Base, Optimistic, Rapid AI): each has a preset Growth Rate, Churn Rate, Marketing %, etc.  
- **Admin-Defined**: The admin can add new scenarios (e.g., “Partner Collaboration Scenario” with different revenue share, or “High Churn Scenario”).  
- **Comparison**: Ability to compare at least **two** scenarios side by side in the same dashboard or in an export.

---

## **11. DASHBOARD STRUCTURE & NAVIGATION**

A **suggested** structure (all must be flexible in final build):

1. **Home / Executive Summary**  
   - Quick KPIs (MRR, ARR, Net Income, Staff, etc.).  
   - Main charts (Revenue vs. Opex, Ending Cash).  

2. **Assumptions / Inputs**  
   - **Tab 1**: **Global / Financial** (tax rate, inflation, projection horizon, initial cash, funding rounds).  
   - **Tab 2**: **Plans & COS** (pricing, setup fees, overages).  
   - **Tab 3**: **Staff & Overheads** (roles, salaries, overhead items, marketing, etc.).  
   - **Tab 4**: **Growth & Churn** (quarterly growth, churn, distribution, initial clients).  
   - **Tab 5**: **Onboarding & Support** (hours, auto-scaling logic).  

3. **Scenarios**  
   - Buttons or dropdown for “Base,” “Optimistic,” “Rapid AI,” or custom.  

4. **Projections**  
   - Dynamic table that updates based on inputs.  
   - Show staff expansions, revenue, net income, etc.  

5. **Comparisons & Exports**  
   - Compare scenario A vs. B.  
   - Export to CSV/Excel/PDF.  

---

## **12. FINAL DELIVERABLES**

1. **Streamlit Application**  
   - A fully working dashboard with **all** inputs described above.  
   - Real-time or near real-time recalculations.  

2. **Source Code**  
   - Organized into modules (e.g., `ui.py`, `calculations.py`, `config.py`).  
   - Thoroughly commented.  
   - Include `requirements.txt` or environment file.  

3. **Documentation**  
   - **README** explaining how to install, run, and update the app.  
   - Explanation of each input tab, how staff hours are calculated, how churn is applied, etc.  

4. **Testing / Validation**  
   - Basic unit tests or at least a checklist ensuring each formula is correct.  

5. **Sample Data**  
   - Optionally provide a sample scenario or seed data file, so users can see an example.  

---

## **13. VALIDATION & TESTING NOTES**

- **Edge Cases**:
  1. **0% Growth** or negative churn.  
  2. **Sky-high** growth (100% monthly).  
  3. **No Overheads** or no staff.  
  4. **No Funding** vs. multiple large rounds.  
  5. **Churn > Growth** leading to negative client counts (should be bounded at zero).  
- **Performance**:  
  - Monthly projections for 10 years = 120 periods. Ensure performance is acceptable.  
- **Data Consistency**:  
  - If user changes the period type (e.g., from annual to monthly), recalculate or re-interpret the growth/churn rates carefully.  
- **Scenario Testing**:  
  - Confirm scenario toggles instantly recalculate tables & charts.

# **PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER**

By following this **ultra-detailed** specification, the Streamlit-based Financial & Operational Dashboard will have:

1. **A Full Admin Panel** with **all** inputs: from salaries, overhead, growth, churn, plan pricing, to funding details.  
2. **Real-Time Breakdown** of financial statements and SaaS metrics each period (monthly/quarterly/annual).  
3. **Auto-Scaling Staff Logic** based on onboarding/support hours.  
4. **Funding Rounds** for equity or debt, each properly impacting the Ending Cash (and optionally ownership).  
5. **Scenario Analysis** for multiple growth/churn assumptions with side-by-side comparisons.  
6. **Charts & Tables** for at-a-glance insights and deeper financial detail.  

Every single value shown here (like R4,268 for Basic COS, 160 hours staff capacity, 5% inflation, 10% churn, 6% growth, etc.) **must** appear as editable fields in the final application. The user must be able to override them, and your code should reference them dynamically rather than hard-coding.
